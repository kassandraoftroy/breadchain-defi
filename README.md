# breadchain-defi
Breadchain's BREAD is an ERC20 token pegged 1:1 with Maker's DAI Stablecoin i.e. 1 BREAD can always be minted (created) by supplying 1 DAI, and 1 BREAD can always be burned (destroyed) to redeem 1 DAI.

Under the hood, the DAI fully collateralizing BREAD is supplied to the Compound Finance Protocol where it earns interest for the breadchain ecosystem (only a breadchain multisig can access the accrued interest). 

Think of it as "Crowdstaking" - you stake your dollars so they earn interest, which goes directly towards the breadchain project. As a BREAD holder you retain the ability to burn BREAD and withdraw the staked principal at any time. Or you can continue to hold and transact with BREAD, which, since it is simply wrapped DAI, functions just as well as a cryptoasset that remains stable to the dollar.
